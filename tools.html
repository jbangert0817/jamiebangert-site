      <h2>CRM That Works for You</h2>
      <p>If your CRM isn’t helping you build meaningful relationships and close loans, it’s time for something better. In this business, your database *is* your future. A strong CRM helps you stay top-of-mind, build long-term trust, and scale your communication without losing the human touch.</p>
      <p>At CMG, we use <strong>Surefire CRM</strong> — a platform specifically built for mortgage professionals. It’s intuitive, automated, and tailored to how we engage with clients and partners.</p>

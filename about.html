    <h1>🌻 About Jamie</h1>
    <p>
      I’ve built from the ground up, led from the top, and started over more than once — each time with more clarity, more courage, and a deeper sense of purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m a spiritual, driven, and highly intuitive woman who believes that success isn’t just about what you achieve — it’s about how aligned you feel while you’re doing it. With a background in business analytics and leadership, I’ve spent over a decade helping people navigate not just their careers, but their calling.
    </p>
    <p>
      What matters most to me is trust. Real connection. A no-BS approach grounded in empathy, clarity, and consistency. I’m deeply tuned in to energy — I listen closely, ask the right questions, and show up fully for the people I support.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of work, I’m probably in nature. Hiking with Arlo. Paddleboarding at golden hour. Camping off-grid somewhere quiet and wild. I believe in staying grounded, staying grateful, and building a life that feels just as good as it looks.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’re here, you’re likely looking for something more — and I get it.<br>
      Because this isn’t just about a job. It’s about finding your place.<br>
      And if you’re ready to make a move that <em>actually feels right</em> — I’m here to help.
    </p>

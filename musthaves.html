    <h1>Must Have's</h1>
    <p class="intro">These are the top 4 power tools I believe every loan officer or branch manager should have in their back pocket â€” tools that build trust, boost conversion, and drive success.</p>

    <div class="card">

      <h3>Total Cost Analysis via Mortgage Coach</h3>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Personalized Video Messaging</h3>
      <p>Want to truly stand out? Use short, authentic videos to follow up with clients, thank agents, or explain scenarios. It adds warmth, trust, and human connection that emails just can't touch.</p>
      <p>I use tools like BombBomb, but even simple phone videos uploaded into emails can do the trick.</p>

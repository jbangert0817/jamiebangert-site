      <h2>All In One Loan</h2>
      <p>The All In One Loan combines your mortgage and checking account, allowing you to use your income to pay down your principal faster â€” automatically.</p>
      <p>This loan gives people something theyâ€™ve never had with a mortgage: control. Itâ€™s not just about saving money â€” itâ€™s about financial freedom, flexibility, and building long-term wealth. Every time I share it, it feels like unlocking a door to something smarter. This is the future of mortgage, and I believe in it.</p>

      <h2>HomeFundIt</h2>
      <p>HomeFundIt is a platform that allows buyers to raise down payment funds from their network â€” like crowdfunding, but built specifically for homeownership.</p>
      <p>This tool opens the door for buyers who thought they couldnâ€™t own a home. Itâ€™s creative, itâ€™s community-powered, and itâ€™s a standout reason CMG is different. This isnâ€™t just a feature â€” itâ€™s a mindset shift. Helping more people get into homes is what fires me up.</p>

      <h2>Total Cost Analysis</h2>
      <p>Total Cost Analysis (TCA) is a powerful visual tool that helps clients compare multiple loan options side-by-side â€” with clarity and confidence.</p>
      <p>It's how top loan officers show clients the bigger picture â€” and build trust fast. The TCA lets borrowers understand how different terms impact their wealth over time. Itâ€™s smart, simple, and a total advantage in any market.</p>

      <p>Thereâ€™s nothing more powerful than showing up as a human. Video lets you connect faster, build trust, and close more â€” without the endless follow-ups.</p>
      <p>Whether you're sending a personalized intro, a deal update, or a quick thank you, video messaging is one of the fastest ways to stand out and stay remembered.</p>
